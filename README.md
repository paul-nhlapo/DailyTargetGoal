## 🎯 What Makes This Different

Most task apps are glorified to-do lists. Daily Target Goal is a **productivity operating system** built on three principles:

1. **Reality Over Fantasy** - Track where time actually goes, not where you wish it went
2. **Automatic Adaptation** - Your schedule adjusts to reality, not the other way around
3. **Cognitive Protection** - See only what matters now, not everything at once

---

## ⚡ Core Features

### 🔄 Auto-Ripple Logic
**The Problem:** Task runs over → entire schedule breaks → manual rescheduling hell

**The Solution:** Click "🔄 +15m & Ripple" and all subsequent tasks automatically shift forward. Your schedule stays intact.

**Impact:** Saves 5-10 minutes per adjustment. Eliminates decision fatigue.

---

### 🎯 Focus Mode
**The Problem:** Seeing your 4 PM task at 9 AM creates anxiety and splits attention ("cognitive leakage")

**The Solution:** Full-screen view showing ONLY your current task with a large countdown timer. Nothing else.

**Impact:** Deep work immersion. No distractions. No anxiety about future tasks.

---

### ⏸️ Interference Tracking (Reality Audit)
**The Problem:** You plan 16 hours but don't know where they actually went

**The Solution:** One-tap logging of interruptions. End-of-day "Reality Audit" shows exactly where time disappeared.

**Impact:** Honest data → better planning → reclaim 1-2 hours daily within weeks.

---

### 📦 Standard Features
- Supabase Auth (email/password) with session persistence
- **⚙️ Configurable work hours** - Customize your daily window (start time + duration)
- Task categories (Work, Personal, Health, Learning, Social)
- Time blocking with conflict detection
- Task completion tracking
- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)
- Demo mode (works without Supabase)

---

## 🚀 How to Use This App Effectively

### Morning Routine (5 minutes)

**1. Review Yesterday's Reality Audit**
```
Check: How much time lost to interruptions?
Ask: What patterns do I see?
Adjust: How can I prevent this today?
```

**2. Plan Your 16-Hour Window**
```
- Add tasks for the day
- Set time blocks (be realistic based on yesterday's data)
- Schedule 2-3 "Focus Mode" blocks for deep work
- Leave 30-60 min buffer for expected interruptions
```

**3. Prioritize Ruthlessly**
```
- Put most important tasks early (before interruptions hit)
- Use categories to balance work/life
- Don't overcommit - you have 16 hours, not 24
```

---

### During Your Day

**When Starting a Task:**
- If it's your current task → Click "🎯 Enter Focus Mode"
- Hide distractions, see only the countdown timer
- Work until timer expires or task completes

**When a Task Runs Over:**
- Don't panic or manually reschedule
- Click "🔄 +15m & Ripple" to extend + auto-shift everything
- Your schedule stays intact automatically

**When Interrupted:**
- Click "⏸️ Log Interference" immediately
- Handle the interruption
- Click "▶️ End Interference" and log what happened
- Continue working - the app tracks reality for you

**Between Tasks:**
- Take 5-10 minute breaks
- Check what's next (but don't worry about tasks 3 hours away)
- Adjust if needed using Auto-Ripple

---

### Evening Review (5 minutes)

**1. Check Your Reality Audit**
```
Total interference time: _____ minutes
Most common interruptions: _____
Effective hours: 16 - interference = _____
```

**2. Analyze Patterns**
```
- Same interruptions daily? → Set boundaries
- Consistent overruns? → Improve time estimates
- Low effective hours? → Schedule buffer time
```

**3. Adjust Tomorrow's Plan**
```
- Use today's data to plan realistically
- Block time for expected interruptions
- Schedule deep work when interruptions are lowest
```

---

### Weekly Review (15 minutes)

**Track These Metrics:**
- Average effective hours per day (goal: increase weekly)
- Focus Mode sessions completed (goal: 2-3 daily)
- Week-over-week interference reduction (goal: 10% decrease)
- Task completion rate (goal: 80%+)

**Optimize Based on Data:**
- Identify your "golden hours" (least interruptions)
- Schedule deep work during golden hours
- Set boundaries around common interruptions
- Improve time estimates using historical data

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

### Tip 1: The Reality Buffer
After week 1, add a 30-60 minute "buffer block" to your daily schedule. This accounts for inevitable interruptions and prevents constant rippling.

### Tip 2: Focus Mode Sprints
Schedule 90-minute Focus Mode blocks for deep work. The countdown creates urgency that boosts quality and speed.

### Tip 3: Interference Patterns
If Reality Audit shows consistent 2-3 PM interruptions, schedule low-focus tasks then. Save deep work for your "golden hours."

### Tip 4: Auto-Ripple Strategy
Schedule most important tasks early. If they overrun, Auto-Ripple pushes less critical afternoon tasks, not your priorities.

### Tip 5: Honest Logging
Log ALL interruptions over 3 minutes. The goal is brutal honesty, not perfection. Self-deception kills productivity.

### Tip 6: Weekly Optimization
Every Sunday, review your week's Reality Audits. Calculate "effective hours" (16 - interference). Aim to increase this weekly.

## 🎓 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Overcommitting** - Scheduling 16 hours of tasks with no buffer
✅ Schedule 14-15 hours, leave room for reality

❌ **Ignoring Reality Audit** - Tracking but not adjusting
✅ Review daily, optimize weekly, adjust continuously

❌ **Skipping Focus Mode** - Staying in task list view all day
✅ Use Focus Mode for all deep work (2-3 sessions daily)

❌ **Not logging small interruptions** - "It was only 5 minutes"
✅ Log everything over 3 minutes - they add up to hours

❌ **Manual rescheduling** - Moving tasks one by one
✅ Use Auto-Ripple - it's faster and eliminates errors

❌ **Perfectionism** - Trying to eliminate all interruptions
✅ Manage interruptions, don't eliminate them (impossible)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I don't see the Focus Mode button"**
→ Focus Mode only appears when current time is within a task's scheduled window

**"Auto-Ripple pushed my task past my end time"**
→ You overcommitted. Defer the last task to tomorrow or compress it.

**"How do I change my work hours?"**
→ Click ⚙️ Settings (top right on Today page) to customize your daily window

**"My Reality Audit shows 6+ hours of interruptions"**
→ This is your baseline. Use this data to set boundaries and schedule buffer time.

**"Tasks aren't saving"**
→ Check Supabase credentials in `.env.local` and ensure schema.sql was run

**More help:** See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) troubleshooting section

## 💬 Philosophy

This app is built on a simple truth: **You can't manage what you don't measure.**

Most productivity apps let you plan a fantasy schedule. This one shows you reality, then helps you optimize it.

- **Auto-Ripple** eliminates schedule management overhead
- **Focus Mode** creates deep work immersion
- **Reality Audit** provides brutal honesty about time usage

Together, they create a feedback loop that transforms your 16 waking hours into a productivity superpower.
